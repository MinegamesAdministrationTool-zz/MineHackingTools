here's detections in kleenscan and antiscan.me https://kleenscan.com/scan_result/d7d6ad19c0a57f7f78c186aca6ae44ebfa70e1d3d04aa75668bf545e3a496ffe | https://antiscan.me/scan/new/result?id=W54VYjaovxyw and it succesfully evaded from most AV's that most people use like AVG and Avast, etc....

but i don't think the detection will be the same because i released that xD
